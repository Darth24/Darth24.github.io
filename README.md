My GitHub account has been created for my future projects to help me learn programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++
This repository is made to act as a "notebook" where I can write my ideas and future projects.
I created this clone repository by going to the "+" icon and creating a new repository and giving it a title. Then I clicked on the "+" icon again to choose "clone a repository" where I then downloaded it onto my computer and placed it into its own GitHub folder on my computer
