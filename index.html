      I am currently studying computer programming, although I enjoy practicing the coding and working with the syntax it does come with quite a few challenges.
      In my free time I like to travel and ride offroad vehicles such as, dirt bikes, through highspeed trails and jumps. I also enjoy playing video games and 
      currently playing Elden Ring, Overwatch 2, and Star Wars Battlefront 2.
